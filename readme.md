# Masquerade

This repository contains Python and R scripts to mask VCF files.

Changes in Version 0 (August 8, 2024):
- There are currently two scripts: ``fb_msp.R`` and ``msp_vcf.py``. Both of them are intended for command line usage:
  - ``python msp_vcf.py <MSP_path> <VCF_path> <ancestry_number_to_replace_with_.> <name_of_new_VCF_file>``
  - ``rscript fb_msp.R <FB_path> <MSP_path> <name_of_new_MSP_file>``
